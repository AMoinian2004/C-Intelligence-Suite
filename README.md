# Here's a demonstration of my library: https://youtu.be/wf0WcMoy_xo
# To Download:
1. Click the "Download ZIP" button under the green "Code" button.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Move all contents inside the folder into the folder of the C++ file you want to use it in.
4. Write #include "MLLibrary.h" at the top of the C++ file you want to use it in.

NOTE: The main.cpp file includes test cases. It is advised for you to delete the main.cpp file, unless you don't have a main.cpp file in your project already and want to use the test cases.
